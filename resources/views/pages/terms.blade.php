        # Terms of Service
        This license is a legal agreement between you and Envy Client ("we") for the use of Envy Client (the
        “Software”). By downloading any Envy Client files you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
        license. We reserve the right to alter this agreement at any time, for any reason, without notice.

        ## Permitted Use
        Each account is tied to a physical machine. Each additional physical machine using the Software requires an
        additional account with an active subscription.

        ## Restrictions
        You may:
        * Use the Software only on Microsoft Windows. Linux and macOS are not supported.

        You may not:
        * Reproduce, distribute, or transfer the Software, or portions thereof, to any third party.
        * Sell, rent, lease, assign and modify the Software or portions thereof.
        * Grant rights to any other person.

        Any violations of these restrictions are grounds for termination.

        ## Refunds
        We offer refunds provided you contact us with 24 hours of purchase, with a valid reason. We do not offer trials.
        After these 24 hours, you are no longer eligible for a refund.

        ## Data Collection
        We try to collect very minimal data but here is what we collect:
        * Hardware Identification that can and is used to identify a user's machine.
        * Telemetry data consisting of how the Software is used.

        ## Cookies
        https://panel.envyclient.com relies on "cookie" technology to allow you to re-access your registered account
        profile during a web session. This mechanism is employed solely for your convenience and no other purpose.
